            <ul>

                    Although the number of shares outstanding increases, there is no change to the company's total market capitalization as the price of each share is split as well" (Gratton, 2024). </li>

            <h3>Forward and Reverse Split Examples</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The number of shares outstanding double, if there were 10 million, there is now 20 million outstanding.</li>
                        <li>The price of the stock splits in half, if it was $10 it is now $5.</li>
